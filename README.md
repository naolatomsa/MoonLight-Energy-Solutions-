# Solar Radiation Data Analysis and Insights

This project aims to analyze solar radiation datasets from **Benin**, **Sierra Leone**, and **Togo** to provide actionable insights for optimizing solar energy investments. The analysis supports **MoonLight Energy Solutions** in identifying high-potential regions and operational strategies to maximize efficiency and sustainability.

## Project Objectives

- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends in solar radiation, temperature, and wind conditions.
- Identify anomalies, correlations, and key factors influencing solar efficiency.
- Develop actionable recommendations for strategic solar installations.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:


## Features

1. **EDA**:
   - Separate notebooks for analyzing each dataset.
   - Cleaning, outlier detection, and statistical summaries.
   - Visualizations to uncover trends and anomalies.

2. **Streamlit Dashboard**:
   - Interactive web app for visualizing solar radiation insights.
   - Region-wise comparisons of solar potential.

3. **Modular Scripts**:
   - Reusable Python scripts for missing value handling, anomaly detection, and statistical analysis.

## Getting Started
