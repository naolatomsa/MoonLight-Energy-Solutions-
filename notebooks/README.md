# Notebooks Folder

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of solar radiation datasets from **Benin**, **Sierra Leone**, and **Togo**. Each notebook provides an in-depth analysis of the respective dataset to uncover trends, correlations, and actionable insights for optimizing solar energy investments.

## Notebooks Overview

- **`eda_benin.ipynb`**: EDA for Benin's dataset, focusing on solar radiation patterns, temperature impacts, and cleaning efficiency.
- **`eda_sierra_leone.ipynb`**: Analysis of Sierra Leone's dataset, highlighting wind variability and its impact on solar efficiency.
- **`eda_togo.ipynb`**: Insights into Togo's dataset, with a focus on identifying seasonal trends and mitigating humidity effects.

## Key Features

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handling missing values, negative entries, and outliers.
2. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Investigating relationships between solar radiation, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
3. **Visualizations**:
   - Line charts, histograms, scatter plots, and wind roses to present data trends effectively.
4. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Identifying unusual patterns or outliers for further investigation.

## How to Use

1. Open the desired notebook (`.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Ensure the required dependencies are installed (e.g., `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).
3. Run the cells step by step to reproduce the EDA process for the selected dataset.

## Requirements

The notebooks require the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `windrose` (for wind rose plots)

Install the required libraries with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn windrose
